Delendum specializes in the zero-knowledge domain. We build and support early-stage zero-knowledge based projects with research and development resources. We curated a list of resources below, aiming to provide a knowledge base and to cover developer needs. We will add more sections soon, such as project evaluations.

If you are interested in collaborations, please feel free to contact us through hello@delendum.xyz. We are also open to advise projects, provide reviews, and co-author research publications. You can join the discussion group chat with other developers and researchers: https://delendum.xyz/telegram
